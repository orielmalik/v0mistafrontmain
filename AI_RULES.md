# AI Rules for this Project

## Language
- All responses, comments, and explanations must be written in **English**
- Code comments must also be in English

## Project Overview
- This is a **Graph Builder** web application
- Built with **React + Next.js**
- Initial structure and components were generated using **v0**
- There are two main user roles:
    - **Operators**: can create, edit, and manage graphs
    - **Readers (Users)**: can view, traverse, and consume graphs, but cannot modify them

## Architecture & Tech Stack
- Framework: **Next.js (App Router)**
- UI: React components (client & server components where appropriate)
- State management: keep logic minimal and explicit
- Prefer modern React patterns (hooks, composition)

## Code Style & Quality
- Write **clean, readable, and maintainable** code
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions
- Prefer explicit logic over “magic” behavior
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Do not introduce new libraries unless clearly justified

## Graph Logic Rules
- Graph structure must be **deterministic and predictable**
- Nodes and edges must have stable, unique identifiers
- Operators can:
    - Add, remove, and edit nodes and edges
- Readers can:
    - View graph structure
    - Navigate flows
    - Answer / consume graph content
- Never allow Readers to mutate graph data

## Safety & Boundaries
- Do NOT modify:
    - Authentication logic
    - Authorization / role checks
    - Dockerfile or deployment config
    - Backend API contracts
      without explicit confirmation
- Always consider **security and data integrity** when suggesting changes

## v0 Compatibility
- Respect the existing structure generated by **v0**
- Do not refactor or restructure v0-generated components unless necessary
- Prefer incremental changes over large rewrites

## UX & Behavior
- UI should be clear and operator-friendly
- Avoid breaking existing user flows
- When changing UI behavior, explain the impact clearly

## Communication Rules
- Before making large changes:
    - Explain what will change
    - Explain why it is needed
- When unsure, ask for clarification instead of guessing
